# Challenge 1
# Ask the user for a number and a length.
# Create a program that prints a list of multiples of the number until the list length reaches length.
# Examples

# number: 7 - length 5 ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

# number: 12 - length 10 ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

# number: 17 - length 6 ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102]

user_num = int(input("Please choose a number between 1 and 10: "))
user_length = int(input("Please choose a length between 1 and 10: "))

multi = []

for i in range (1, user_length + 1):
    multi.append(user_num * i)

print(multi)

print("----------")

# Write a program that asks a string to the user, and display a new string with any duplicate consecutive letters removed.
# Examples

# user's word : "ppoeemm" ➞ "poem"

# user's word : "wiiiinnnnd" ➞ "wind"

# user's word : "ttiiitllleeee" ➞ "title"

# user's word : "cccccaaarrrbbonnnnn" ➞ "carbon"
# Notes
# Final strings won’t include words with double letters (e.g. “passing”, “lottery”).

user_word = input("Please choose a word: ")
new_word = ""
